Explanation of Flow Control and Jumbo Frames (Cisco Support Email)

Topic: Technical clarification on Flow Control and Jumbo Frames features on Cisco switches

ðŸ§¾ Key Points:
Flow Control:

A method for managing packet transmission rates between devices.

If a receiving device (e.g., switch A) becomes overwhelmed, it sends a pause frame to the sender (e.g., switch B) to slow down traffic.

Jumbo Frames:

Allows transmission of Ethernet frames larger than the standard 1500 bytes (e.g., up to 9000 bytes).

Beneficial for large file transfers between systems, as fewer packets are needed.

Compatibility:

While Cisco documentation does not explicitly confirm compatibility, both Flow Control and Jumbo Frames can function together.
