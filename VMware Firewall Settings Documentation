# 🔥 VMware Firewall Settings Documentation

This README provides an overview of required firewall configurations and rules for VMware environments. These settings are essential for ensuring proper communication between ESXi hosts, vCenter, storage, backup systems, and other infrastructure components.

---

## 🛠️ Purpose

Proper VMware firewall configuration ensures:

- Seamless vMotion and management connectivity
- iSCSI/NFS storage access
- vSphere Client access
- Backup integration
- Time synchronization
- Licensing and directory services communication

## ✅ Enabling/Disabling Services (ESXi UI)

1. Log in to **ESXi Host Client** (`https://<host-IP>`)
2. Navigate to **Host > Manage > Services**
3. Start, stop, or restart services as needed
4. To open firewall ports:
   - Go to **Manage > Firewall**
   - Enable required **incoming** and **outgoing** rule sets

## 🔍 CLI Configuration Examples

To enable NTP and open port 123:

```bash
esxcli network firewall ruleset set -e true -r ntpClient
