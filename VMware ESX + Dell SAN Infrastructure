\# ASHP VMware ESX + Dell SAN Infrastructure



This repository documents the architecture and configuration of the enterprise storage and virtualization solution implemented for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). The system integrates VMware ESX servers with Dell PowerEdge servers and Dell MD-series storage arrays (MD3000, MD1000) via SAS and iSCSI networks.



\## üßë‚Äçüíº Role



\*\*Infrastructure Engineer\*\*  

Designed and deployed a highly available, tiered storage environment supporting VMware ESX virtualization, built on Dell PowerEdge hardware and Dell SANmelody-based arrays.



\## üìê Architecture Overview



\- \*\*Virtualization Platform\*\*: VMware ESX (Dell PowerEdge 6850)

\- \*\*Storage Arrays\*\*: Dell MD3000 (head) and MD1000 (expansion shelves)

\- \*\*Servers\*\*: Dell 2950 (Storage Tier Controller), Dell PowerEdge 6850 (VM Host)

\- \*\*Network Interfaces\*\*:

&nbsp; - DRAC for out-of-band management

&nbsp; - Quad-port NIC (top 2 for iSCSI, bottom 2 reserved)

&nbsp; - Dual-port NIC (top = DMZ, bottom = Data)

&nbsp; - Dedicated NICs for VMotion and Service Console

\- \*\*Storage Connectivity\*\*:

&nbsp; - Dual SAS Controllers connecting MD3000 to MD1000 expansion shelves

&nbsp; - Redundant paths (A \& B) for high availability

\- \*\*Management\*\*: Single port NIC for RDP; DRAC for iDRAC access



\## üîå Connection Map



The system uses redundant SAS links between storage arrays and servers to ensure data path availability and failover protection.



\- MD3000 ‚Üî MD1000-A1 ‚Üí MD1000-A2 (Path A)

\- MD3000 ‚Üî MD1000-B1 ‚Üí MD1000-B2 (Path B)



Each path is driven by independent SAS controllers on the storage server for fault tolerance.



\## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used



\- VMware ESX Server

\- Dell PowerEdge 6850 \& 2950

\- Dell MD3000, MD1000 SAN arrays

\- Dell DRAC

\- iSCSI \& SAS storage networking

\- SANmelody (DataCore-based storage virtualization)



\## üóÇÔ∏è Documentation



Included:

\- `/Visio-ESX and SANmelody.pdf`: Hardware topology and network diagrams (Front View, Rear View, Logical View)



\## üîê Key Considerations



\- Multi-path storage access using SAS for high availability

\- Segmented NICs for VM traffic, DMZ, iSCSI, and management

\- DRAC used for secure remote management

\- iSCSI NICs isolated on separate VLANs for performance and security

\- VMware VMotion network separated for seamless live migration



\## üìà Outcomes



\- Enabled reliable, high-performance storage for VMware VMs

\- Achieved redundancy at both the network and storage layer

\- Designed a scalable storage backend capable of future expansion
