# VMware Virtual Infrastructure Deployment – ASHP

This project documents the design and implementation of an enterprise-grade VMware Virtual Infrastructure for the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). The deployment included the full setup of VMware VirtualCenter Server, VI Client, ESX hosts, and License Server in a secure and firewall-controlled enterprise environment.

## 🧑‍💼 Role & Responsibilities

**Role**: VMware Infrastructure Engineer  
**Client**: American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP)  
**Scope**: Design, implement, document, and maintain VMware-based virtualization infrastructure.

## 🛠️ Key Responsibilities

- Designed and implemented VMware VirtualCenter Server with a custom SQL database backend and internal DNS configuration.
- Installed and configured the VI Client, License Server, and ESX Hosts for centralized VM management.
- Managed firewall configurations and ensured secure port communication between VirtualCenter, ESX hosts, and clients (Ports: 80, 443, 902, 27000, 27010).
- Implemented high-availability capabilities (vMotion, cloning, heartbeat monitoring) across VirtualCenter-managed hosts.
