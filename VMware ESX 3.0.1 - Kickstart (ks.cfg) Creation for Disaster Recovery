# üõ†Ô∏è VMware ESX 3.0.1 - Kickstart (ks.cfg) Creation for Disaster Recovery

This document outlines how to create a `ks.cfg` (Kickstart) file from an existing VMware ESX Server 3.0.1 installation to use in recovering systems during disaster recovery (DR).

---

## üìå Purpose

The Kickstart file allows administrators to automate the reinstallation or recovery of ESX Server systems. This is especially critical in disaster recovery scenarios where minimizing manual configuration is key.

---

## ‚úÖ Enabling Scripted Installation Support

Before using VI Web Access to generate a Kickstart file, you must enable the scripted installation feature:

### Steps:

1. SSH into the ESX Server 3.0.1 service console as `root`.

2. Open the following configuration file in a text editor:
   ```bash
   vi /usr/lib/vmware/webAccess/tomcat/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/webapps/ui/WEB-INF/struts-config.xml
Locate and comment out this section:

xml
Copy
Edit
<action path="/scriptedInstall"
  type="org.apache.struts.actions.ForwardAction"
  parameter="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/disabled.jsp" />
Uncomment the following <action> block:

xml
Copy
Edit
<!--
<action path="/scriptedInstall"
  type="com.vmware.webcenter.scripted.ProcessAction">
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form1" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form1.jsp" />
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form2" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form2.jsp" />
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form3" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form3.jsp" />
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form4" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form4.jsp" />
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form5" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form5.jsp" />
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form6" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form6.jsp" />
  <forward name="scriptedInstall.form7" path="/WEB-INF/jsp/scriptedInstall/form7.jsp" />
</action>
-->
Save and exit the editor.

Restart VMware Web Access:

bash
Copy
Edit
service vmware-webAccess restart
üßæ Creating a Kickstart Script via VI Web Access
After enabling scripted install, follow these steps to generate a kickstart file using the graphical interface:

Step-by-Step Instructions
Launch a supported browser and go to your ESX Server's Web Access URL.

Log in and select Scripted Installer.

Installation Configuration:

Select Initial Installation or Upgrade.

Choose installation method:

Remote (HTTP/FTP/NFS server)

CD-ROM

Provide the appropriate URL or mount path for remote sources.

Network Method:

Choose DHCP or Static IP.

If using static IP, enter:

Hostname

IP Address

Netmask

Gateway

DNS Server(s)

VLAN ID (if applicable)

VM Network Settings:

Choose whether to create default VM networks automatically.

System Configuration:

Time Zone

Reboot after install (Yes recommended)

Root password (entered twice)

License Agreement:

Accept EULA to proceed.

Disk Partitioning:

Define partitions for /boot, /, and swap at minimum.

Choose file system types: ext3, swap, vmfs, etc.

Use /dev/hda for IDE disks.

Use Grow only for non-critical partitions.

Licensing Options:

Post Install ‚Äì configure after installation.

Server Based ‚Äì use a central license server.

File Based ‚Äì use a local license file.

If Server Based:

Provide license server IP and port.

Select license type (Starter or Standard).

If File Based:

Upload license file from disk.

Final Step:

Click Download Kickstart File to save ks.cfg.

üíæ Storage & Deployment
Save the generated ks.cfg file to a:

Floppy disk (legacy deployments)

Network-accessible location (HTTP, FTP, NFS)

Ensure ESX install media is available via:

CD-ROM

Network (HTTP/FTP/NFS)

üîÑ Deployment Strategy for DR
Use one universal Kickstart file with DHCP, then reconfigure IPs post-install.

For critical infrastructure, create individual ks.cfg files per host with unique static IP and hostname.

Store copies in your DR documentation and back them up offsite.

üß™ Testing & Maintenance
Periodically test the scripted install process on spare hardware or lab environments.

Update ks.cfg files if partition layouts or licensing models change.
