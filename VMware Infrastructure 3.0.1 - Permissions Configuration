# 🔐 VMware Infrastructure 3.0.1 - Permissions Configuration

This document outlines the user roles and permissions configured within **VMware Infrastructure 3.0.1 (VI 3.0.1)**, primarily within the VMware VirtualCenter 2.0 environment.

---

## 📋 Overview

Permissions in VMware VI 3.0.1 are role-based and applied at various levels of the vSphere inventory (e.g., datacenter, host, VM, resource pool). Each permission consists of:

- **User/Group** (from Windows Active Directory or local system)
- **Assigned Role** (set of privileges)
- **Inventory Object Scope** (where the permission applies)

| `ASHPLN2\Domain Admins`    | Administrator        | Root (`/`)            |
| `ASHPLN2\CitrixAdmins`     | Virtual Machine User | Cluster or Folder     |
| `ASHPLN2\BackupOps`        | Read-Only            | Resource Pool / Hosts |
| `ASHPLN2\Helpdesk`         | Virtual Machine Power User | VMs Only      |

> ✅ Note: Users like `JoelH` and `Domain Admins` have **full rights** across the entire infrastructure.

## 📁 Permission Structure Reference

Permissions can be set at the following levels:

- Datacenter level
- Cluster level
- ESX host level
- Virtual Machine level
- Resource pool or folder level

> 🚨 **Important**: Permissions do **not inherit downward** unless explicitly configured. Always verify object-specific permissions in VI Client.

---

## 🛠️ How to Modify Permissions

1. Open VMware Infrastructure Client
2. Navigate to the object (e.g., host, VM, folder)
3. Right-click > **Permissions**
4. Click **Add Permission**
5. Select user/group → assign role → check propagation if needed
6. Click **OK**

## 🔄 Backup & Recovery Recommendations

- Export permission configurations (manual notes or screenshots)
- Backup your VirtualCenter database regularly
- Keep a list of critical admin accounts outside of vCenter for DR purposes
