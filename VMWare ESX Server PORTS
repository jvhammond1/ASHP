VMWare ESX Server PORTS
If you have a firewall between two ESX Server hosts and you want to allow transactions
between the hosts or use VirtualCenter to perform any source/target activities, such as
VMware High Availability (HA) traffic, migration, cloning, or VMotion, you must
configure a connection through which the managed hosts can receive data. To do so,
you open ports in the following ranges:
- 902 (server-to-server migration and provisioning traffic)
- 2050–5000 (for HA traffic)
- 8000 (for VMotion)
- 8042–8045 (for HA traffic)
Refer to the firewall system administrator for additional information on configuring the
ports. For more detailed information on the directionality and protocol for these ports,
see “TCP and UDP Ports for Management Access” on page 187.
