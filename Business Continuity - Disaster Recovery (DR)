## 📦 Software Considerations

### **GoVault Software**
- Clarify which version and components should be installed in DR environment.

### **VMware ESX**
- Maintain up-to-date **kickstart config files**.
- Store additional automation scripts and boot-time configs to accelerate host provisioning.

### **Citrix License Server**
- **Do not install** on the same system as **VMware Virtual Center**, due to Apache conflicts.
  - VC uses Apache → conflict with Citrix License server’s own Apache/IIS requirement.
  - Results in error despite installation suggesting IIS is acceptable.
- **Recommended Fix**: Rerun **Windows Server SP2** to repair mismatched IIS files.
